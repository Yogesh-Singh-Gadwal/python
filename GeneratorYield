Yield:- yield is just like the "return" but difference is unlike return ,yield does'nt clear all the local variable's space infact
        it also returns some value to calling function but doesnt clear the momory space of locals the function still works the same
        way it doen't return from the function.
        
Generator funtion:-generater function is just like a normal function but it can generate the value whenever it needs to on run time
          by using Yield;

example:-1;(printing fabonacci numbers)

def fabonacci():                            #defining generator function\
    a,b=0,1;        
    while(1):             
        yield a;                            #yield variable to return the value to calling function
        a,b=b,a+b
print("***************for************")
for i in fabonacci(10):                      #calling the generator function
    if(i>1000):                              #as yield don't clear the function variables that function will never exit this is to make exit from the infinite loop of the function
        break
    print(i)
