LAMBDA:-Python supports the creation of anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name) at runtime,
        using a construct called "lambda".
        
        example:
          import functools
          list1=[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]
          print(functools.reduce(lambda a,b:a+b,list1))
          
          output:-550
          
     
Operator:-operator works exactly like lambda function and it also increases the readability of the code  but for this we have to
          import one more package named "operator".
          
          examples;
          import operator
          list1=[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]
          print(functools.reduce(operator.add,list1))
          
          
          output:-550
