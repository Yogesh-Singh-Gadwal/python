Reduce is a function provided by "functools" package with help of which we can process the wole list or touple in line and can give
just one result of all the values.

example;
  import functools;
  lis=[10,20,3040,50,60,70,80,90,100]
  print(functools.reduce(lambda a,b:a+b,lis))         #output=550
