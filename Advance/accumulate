accumulate is a function provided by the "Itertools" package by which we can update the whole list by any process like addition or
multiplication etc,and the last value of the list will give the the complete processed value

example:-
import itertools
lis=[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]
print(list(itertools.accumulate(lis,lambda a,b:a+b)))


output: [10,30,60,100,150,,210,280,360,450,550]
